This project aims to create a temporary website for Elevador.

Elevador is an initiative in Barcelona that offers an open, safe space to people who want to organize events, small exhibitions, music activities, workshops etc. It is important that people can find Elevador online. Since my skills in building websites are still limited, the goal is to build a 'placeholder' website for now. This temporary website will be replaced by something more advanced in the future.

The initial idea is to create:

* a home page with general information, a nice background picture and some smaller pictures that give a good impression
* a form to contact Elevador

If the placeholder project is successful, the idea is to create the following pages:

* Home (general description, pictures, possibly some quotes from feedback of participants, etc.)
* Past activities (can be a simple list with screenshots from list in Meetup)
* Agenda (would take more work if this has to be updated every time a new event is created in the Meetup calendar)
* Contact us (contact details and contact form)

Future ambition is to link the Meetup calendar to the website so that new events that are created in Meetup will automatically show on the website.

The website will be built with Python and Django, using HTML and CSS, and some Bootstrap elements. As starting database, Django's dbsqlite3 will be used. The website will be deployed with Heroku.
